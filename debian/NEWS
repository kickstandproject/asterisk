asterisk (1:1.6.2.0~dfsg~rc1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  The fix for AST-2009-006 breaks IAX2 line protocol by adding an extra
  step in the IAX2 handshaking. To allow working with unmodified IAX2
  implementations, add the following two lines under [general] in iax.conf:
 
  calltokenoptional = 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0
  maxcallnumbers = 16382

asterisk (1:1.4.13~dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  Since this version, ODBC and IMAP storage for Voicemail are provided.
  As this could not be done as a runtime option, app_voicemail_odbc.so and
  app_voicemail_imap.so are provided. However, these conflict app_voicemail.so
  and each other.
  If you use a modified modules.conf and you have autoload enabled, you *must*
  add explicit noload entries for two of the three voicemail modules.

asterisk (1:1.0.7.dfsg.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  The Debian version of the upstream asterisk source has had the fpm Music on Hold
  removed as this music has only been licenced for use within asterisk which is
  incompatible with the Debian Free Software Guildlines 
  <http://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines>. Please drop your alternative
  Music on Hold into the directory /usr/share/asterisk/mohmp3/
