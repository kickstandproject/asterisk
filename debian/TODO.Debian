* The asterisk canary dies on startup sometimes. Canary is anyway not needed
  on Lenny kernel (>= 2.6.25). But if it dies we lose the effect of 
  real-time priority.
* Canary is not killed when Asterisk is stopped.
* Some man pages to write.
* Remove the TeX sources from the package asterisk-doc .
* Package sound files properly. Maybe in a separate package altogether?
